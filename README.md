<h3>1) This template uses the Scholarly package for python: https://github.com/scholarly-python-package/scholarly</h3>
They make the note: "IMPORTANT: Making certain types of queries, such as scholarly.citedby or scholarly.search_pubs, will lead to Google Scholar blocking your requests and may eventually block your IP address." I have not experienced this issue with the code in this repo running once per day, but please keep this in mind. Their documentation shows how to use proxies if you prefer. <br><br>
If you don't want to use with Scholarly, check out BibBase, which from a quick glance should accomplish similar goals (although not identical) and it should be easy to update the code in this repo to remove the .py and .yml files, and remove the references to them in the js. Here's a link to BibBase https://bibbase.org/documentation *Note I have not tried BibBase, i just found it today.
<h3>I used LLMs to make this code</h3>
I used Claude to help make most of this code. I am not a programmer by trade. Use at your own discretion. If you find errors in the code, please do share so they can be corrected!
